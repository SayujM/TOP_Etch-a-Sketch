# TOP_Etch-a-Sketch
The Odin Project foundation course project

The intention is to create a browser version of a simple sketchpad

Step-1: Creating a simple webpage with m x m number of divs placed as a grid using JS DOM manipulation.

Step-2: Adding an event to capture mouse hovering & changing div's colour to black.

Step-3: Adding an additional check (Ctrl key to be kept down) for triggering colouring along with an option to erase (while keeping Alt key down).

Step-4: Made the colour chosen while colouring to be picked at random.
